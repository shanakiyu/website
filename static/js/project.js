We designed the curatorial narrative, wrote interpretive labels (including adapted versions for children), and conceived the full scenography as a guided spatial journey inside the game. \nBy translating a physical exhibition logic into a digital, non-institutional space, the project questions how finitude, memory, and disappearance can be experienced through virtual environments. \n#VirtualExhibition #Curation #Scenography #Minecraft",

Set in a contemporary, abstracted Dublin, the film follows a solitary man whose emotionally restrained life is briefly illuminated by an intimate encounter, before returning to silence and loss. Rather than retelling the story, the project focuses on perception: sound, light, and rhythm replace inner monologue to express emotional paralysis, epiphany, and belated awareness. \nI was mainly involved in the interpretative analysis, narrative structure, and artistic intention of the project. \n#FilmProject #Adaptation #Storytelling #Literature #Cinema",

Rather than attempting to “repair” missing data, the visualization makes absences visible. A multipartite network connects places of conservation, types of donors, object categories, and creators, deliberately concentrating undocumented authorship into a single “Anonymous” node. Inspired by critical data visualization theories, the project treats visualization not as a neutral tool, but as an interpretative and political act that exposes asymmetries, silences, and power relations embedded in cultural datasets. \n#DataVisualization #CriticalDesign #CriticalData #PostcolonialData",

Hybrid ads combine ego and ethics, illustrating the car as both an extension of the self and a vehicle for social and ecological values. \nThe project demonstrates how data-driven media analysis can illuminate cultural and moral shifts in commercial narratives. \n#DataAnalysis #CulturalStudies #CriticalAnalytics #MediaStudies #Identity",

We chose Marie Antoinette as our central character, precisely because of her enduring ambiguity and the myths surrounding her figure. \nThe project reimagines her life by revisiting key moments that shaped her historical trajectory and proposing alternative outcomes.

Numbers are encoded through rings worn on fingers and phalanges, turning the hands into tools for calculation, memory, and communication. Arithmetic operations rely on symmetry, spatial alignment, and gesture rather than linear notation. By avoiding a single canonical way of writing numbers, the system emphasizes plurality, embodiment, and reversibility. \nIt questions how numerical systems structure value, authority, and social order, and proposes an alternative, physically grounded model of computation. \n#HypotheticalNumericalSystem #EmbodiedComputation #SpeculativeDesign #AlternativeMath #BodyAsInterface #ResearchProject #HistoricalCountingSystems #ChrisomalisInspired #GesturalArithmetic",

My academic background is built on a dual foundation: the mathematical rigor of Data Science and the analytical depth of the Human Sciences. I specialize in bridging the gap between technical infrastructures and human behavior. \nMy work focuses on the interaction between users and digital environments. Whether I am modeling cinematic networks using SQL, analyzing behavioral data from immersive spaces, or exploring the cognitive impact of virtual interfaces, I apply a multidisciplinary approach to understand how digital systems structure information and perception. \nI am a "Learning by Doing" advocate. This portfolio, which I developed from scratch (Flask/SQL), is a practical laboratory for my research in full-stack development and interface design. My goal is to work as a strategic intermediary—someone capable of navigating between engineering, data analysis, and project management to solve complex problems in evolving industries.',

By recreating the 2000s-era 'Early Web' aesthetic, I wanted to move away from today’s standardized layouts to explore a more discovery-oriented interface. In line with my interest in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), I have integrated AI Augmentation (Gemini) to transform vintage visual assets into a functional, modern experience. This process allows me to bridge the gap between 'lo-fi' hardware history and the generative technologies of today. \n<b>Ethical & Educational Note</b> As a student of both Data Science and Digital Culture, I treat this project as a non-commercial, educational experiment in Remix Culture. It is a practical laboratory for testing how we can repurpose technological heritage to build new types of interactive environments.\n\n<a href='https://substack.com/home/post/p-182230799' target='_blank' style='color:#000080; text-decoration:underline;'><b>Read my first article about the inspiration behind this portfolio.</b></a>",
